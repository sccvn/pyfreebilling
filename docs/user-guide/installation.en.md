# One-Step Automated Install

You may install P-KISS-SBC using the following command:

```bash

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sccvn/pyfreebilling/dev/src/pks | bash
```

!!! info
    Piping to `bash` is a controversial topic, as it prevents you from reading code that is about to run on your system.

    If you would prefer to review the code before installation, you have an option before running the script.
